# Creative Computing Works

This repository contains a collection of creative computing projects, exploring topics like data visualization, AI, and physical computing. Each project involves tangible representations of data and showcases how creative coding and computational tools can be used to engage with complex topics such as environmental issues.

## Projects Overview

### 1. **Basin Project**
   - **Description**: This project visualizes sewage discharge data through a 3D-printed basin artefact, symbolizing the relationship between hygiene and environmental pollution. The basin was resin-coated to provide a tactile quality.
   - **Technologies Used**: Python, 3D printing, data visualization
   - **Current Status**: Placeholder for program files and setup images.
   - [More Details](./basin/README.md)

### 2. **Stool Project**
   - **Description**: This project focuses on creating a physical representation of sewage discharge data using a stool-like structure. The stool served as a probe for user engagement.
   - **Technologies Used**: Python, CNC machining, data mapping
   - **Current Status**: Placeholder for program files and setup images.
   - [More Details](./stool/README.md)

### 3. **Data Streams Project**
   - **Description**: A project that explores real-time data streams, converting raw sewage data into tangible forms.
   - **Technologies Used**: Python, data streaming APIs, visualization tools
   - **Current Status**: Placeholder for program files and setup images.
   - [More Details](./data_streams/README.md)

### 4. **Gen-AR Poster**
   - **Description**: This project involves generating augmented reality posters that represent complex data visually in physical spaces.
   - **Technologies Used**: Python, AR development tools
   - **Current Status**: Placeholder for program files and setup images.
   - [More Details](./gen-ar_poster/README.md)

### 5. **Data Visualization Project**
   - **Description**: A data visualization project focusing on environmental data, particularly visualizing sewage discharge patterns.
   - **Technologies Used**: Python, data visualization libraries
   - **Current Status**: Placeholder for program files and setup images.
   - [More Details](./data_vis/README.md)

### 6. **AI Voice Project**
   - **Description**: This project explores the use of AI-generated voices to communicate environmental data, transforming sewage discharge data into auditory forms.
   - **Technologies Used**: Python, AI voice generation, data sonification
   - **Current Status**: Placeholder for program files and setup images.
   - [More Details](./ai_voice/README.md)
